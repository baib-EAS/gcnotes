For sake of convenience, 
below I use **$HEMCO** as the root directory of HEMCO files,
**$GCClassic** as the root directory of GEOS-Chem 13.0.0 source code.
### 1. check your new HEMCO nc file used to input
Assume my new CH3I ocean concentration map is stored as : **$HEMCO/CH3I/v2021-01/MONTHLY.OCEAN.CH3I.$YYYY.nc** \
firstly I need to determining if your netCDF file is **COARDS-compliant**, i.e. GEOS-Chem-accepted\
normaly, you can find a script **isCoards** in this path: **$GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem/NcdfUtil/perl/**, which can be used to examine your nc file \
```
ls ~/p-pliu40-0/GC/GCClassic.13.0.0/src/GEOS-Chem/NcdfUtil/perl/isCoards
```
To use this script, you need to load package **ncl** to activate **ncdump** command by:
```
source /storage/coda1/p-pliu40/0/shared/GEOS-Chem/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
spack load ncl
```
After that, you can check your nc file with this command:
```
$GCClassic/src/GEOS-Chem/NcdfUtil/perl/isCoards $HEMCO/CH3I/v2021-01/MONTHLY.OCEAN.CH3I.$YYYY.nc
```
the output is like this:
```
The following items adhere to the COARDS standard:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Dimension "lon" adheres to standard usage
-> Dimension "lat" adheres to standard usage
-> Dimension "time" adheres to standard usage
-> lon(lon)
-> lon is monotonically increasing
-> lon:units = "degrees_east"
-> lat(lat)
-> lat is monotonically increasing
-> lat:units = "degrees_north"
-> time(time)
-> time is monotonically increasing
-> time:calendar = "proleptic_gregorian"
-> time:units = "days since 2003-01-01 00:00:00"
-> CH3I_OCEAN(time,lat,lon)
-> CH3I_OCEAN:long_name = NaNf

The following items DO NOT ADHERE to the COARDS standard:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> lon:long_name (or lon:standard_name) is missing
-> lat:long_name (or lat:standard_name) is missing
-> time:long_name (or time:standard_name) is missing
-> CH3I_OCEAN:long_name (or CH3I_OCEAN:standard_name) is missing
-> CH3I_OCEAN:units is missing
-> The "conventions" global attribute is missing
-> The "history" global attribute is missing
-> The "title" global attribute is missing

The following optional items are RECOMMENDED:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Consider adding lon:axis ="X"
-> Consider adding lat:axis = "Y"
-> Consider adding time:axis = "T"
-> Consider adding CH3I_OCEAN:missing_value
-> Consider adding CH3I_OCEAN:add_offset
-> Consider adding CH3I_OCEAN:scale_factor
-> Consider adding the "format" global attribute
-> Consider adding the "references" global attribute

For more information how to fix non COARDS-compliant items, see:
http://wiki.geos-chem.org/Preparing_data_files_for_use_with_HEMCO
```
according to this, you can change the attribute which *DO NOT ADHERE to the COARDS standard* of your nc file using Python **xaary**, here is an example of python script:
```
CH3I = xr.open_mfdataset('$HEMCO/CH3I/monthly/v202101/MONTHLY.OCEAN.CH3I.2010.nc')
CH3I.lat.attrs['units'] = 'degrees_north'
CH3I.lat.attrs['standard_name'] = 'latitude'
CH3I.lat.attrs['long_name'] = 'Latitude'
CH3I.lat.attrs['axis'] = 'X'
CH3I.lon.attrs['units'] = 'degrees_east'
CH3I.lon.attrs['standard_name'] = 'longitude'
CH3I.lon.attrs['long_name'] = 'Longitude'
CH3I.lon.attrs['axis'] = 'Y'
CH3I.time.attrs['standard_name'] = 'time'
CH3I.time.attrs['long_name'] = 'Time'
CH3I.time.attrs['calender'] = 'standard'
CH3I.time.attrs['axis'] = 'T'
CH3I.CH3I_OCEAN.attrs['units'] = 'kg/m3'
CH3I.CH3I_OCEAN.attrs['long_name'] = 'global ocean methyl iodide concentration'
CH3I.attrs['Conventions'] = "COARDS"
CH3I.attrs['history'] = "Mon Jan 01 00:00:00 2021 UTC"
CH3I.attrs['Title'] = "COARDS/netCDF file containing ocean methyl iodide concentration data"
CH3I.to_netcdf('$HEMCO/CH3I/monthly/v202101/MONTHLY.OCEAN.CH3I.2010.Examined.nc')
```
make sure your nc file is adhere to GEOS-Chem requirement, and go on to next step.\

### 2. change fortran source code
```
cd $GCClassic/src/HEMCO/src/Extensions
ls
```
this directory is for the code of **Extensions** controlling emission other than those in **Core** Extensions.\
you can find **hcox_seaflux_mod.F90** which is in charge of the seaflux emission of several species now.
```
vi hcox_seaflux_mod.F90
```
the basic description of seaflux computation is as below:
> The oceanic flux is parameterized according to Liss and Slater, 1974:

> **F = K<sub>g</sub> x ( C<sub>air</sub> - HÂ·C<sub>water</sub> )**

> where F is the net flux, \
> K<sub>g</sub> is the exchange velocity, \
> C<sub>air</sub> and C<sub>water</sub> are the air and aqueous concentrations, respectively, \
> and H is the dimensionless air over water Henry constant. \
> This module calculates the source and sink terms separately. The source is given as flux, the sink as deposition rate:

> source = K<sub>g</sub> x H x C<sub>water</sub>     [kg m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>] \
> sink   = K<sub>g</sub> / DEPHEIGHT      [s<sup>-1</sup>] 

> The deposition rate is obtained by dividing the exchange velocity by the deposition height DEPHEIGHT, e.g. the height over which deposition occurs. \
> This can be either the first grid box only, or the entire planetary boundary layer. \
> The HEMCO option 'PBL_DRYDEP' determines which option is being used. \
> K<sub>g</sub> is calculated following Johnson, 2010, which is largely based on the work of Nightingale et al., 2000a/b. \
>  The salinity and seawater pH are currently set to constant global values  of 35 ppt and 8.0, respectively. 

go to **LINE 690** of **hcox_seaflux_mod.F90**, the code here is:
```
    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ! Get species IDs and settings
    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ! # of species for which air-sea exchange will be calculated
    Inst%nOcSpc = 7  ! updated to include MENO3, ETNO3, MOH

    ! Initialize vector w/ species information
    ALLOCATE ( Inst%OcSpecs(Inst%nOcSpc) )
    DO I = 1, Inst%nOcSpc
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%HcoID      = -1
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcSpcName  = ''
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcDataName = ''
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%LiqVol     = 0d0
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%SCWPAR     = 1
    ENDDO

    ! Counter
    I = 0

    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ! CH3I:
    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I = I + 1
    IF ( I > Inst%nOcSpc ) THEN
       CALL HCO_ERROR ( HcoState%Config%Err, ERR, RC )
       RETURN
    ENDIF

    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcSpcName  = 'CH3I'
    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcDataName = 'CH3I_SEAWATER'
    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%LiqVol     = 1d0*7d0 + 3d0*7d0 + 1d0*38.5d0 ! Johnson, 2010
    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%SCWPAR     = 1 ! Schmidt number following Johnson, 2010

```
Copy a loop and change the **OcSpcName** and **OcDataName** and conresponding **LiqVol** and **SCWPAR** and add **Inst%nOcSpc** by 1. \
Here, **OcSpcName** should exactly be the species name defined in GEOS-Chem, \
**OcDataName** is the array used to pass data, no restriction yet better to be self-explained, \
refer to the description in source code file about **LiqVol** and **SCWPAR**. 

## 2. check HEMCO file
