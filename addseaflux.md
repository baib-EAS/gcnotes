For sake of convenience, 
below I use **$HEMCO** as the root directory of HEMCO files,
**$GCClassic** as the root directory of GEOS-Chem 13.0.0 source code.
### 1. change fortran source code
```
cd $GCClassic/src/HEMCO/src/Extensions
ls
```
this directory is for the code of **Extensions** controlling emission other than those in **Core** Extensions.\
you can find **hcox_seaflux_mod.F90** which is in charge of the seaflux emission of several species now.
```
vi hcox_seaflux_mod.F90
```
the basic description of seaflux computation is as below:

> The oceanic flux is parameterized according to Liss and Slater, 1974:
>    F = K<sub>g</sub> * ( C<sub>air</sub> - HÂ·C<sub>water</sub> )
> where F is the net flux, Kg is the exchange velocity, Cair and Cwater
> are the air and aqueous concentrations, respectively, and H is the
> dimensionless air over water Henry constant.

! This module calculates the source and sink terms separately. The source
! is given as flux, the sink as deposition rate:
! source = Kg * H * Cwater     [kg m-2 s-1]
! sink   = Kg / DEPHEIGHT      [s-1]
!
! The deposition rate is obtained by dividing the exchange velocity Kg
! by the deposition height DEPHEIGHT, e.g. the height over which
! deposition occurs. This can be either the first grid box only, or the
! entire planetary boundary layer. The HEMCO option 'PBL\_DRYDEP' determines
! which option is being used.
!\\
!\\
! Kg is calculated following Johnson, 2010, which is largely based on
! the work of Nightingale et al., 2000a/b.
! The salinity and seawater pH are currently set to constant global values
! of 35 ppt and 8.0, respectively.
! Since Kg is only little sensitive to these variables, this should not
! introduce a notable error.
