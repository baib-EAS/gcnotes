For sake of convenience, 
below I use **$HEMCO** as the root directory of HEMCO files,
**$GCClassic** as the root directory of GEOS-Chem 13.0.0 source code.
### 1. change fortran source code
```
cd $GCClassic/src/HEMCO/src/Extensions
ls
```
this directory is for the code of **Extensions** controlling emission other than those in **Core** Extensions.\
you can find **hcox_seaflux_mod.F90** which is in charge of the seaflux emission of several species now.
```
vi hcox_seaflux_mod.F90
```
the basic description of seaflux computation is as below:
> The oceanic flux is parameterized according to Liss and Slater, 1974:\
>       **F = K<sub>g</sub> * ( C<sub>air</sub> - HÂ·C<sub>water</sub> )**\
> where F is the net flux, \
> K<sub>g</sub> is the exchange velocity, \
> C<sub>air</sub> and C<sub>water</sub> are the air and aqueous concentrations, respectively, \
> and H is the dimensionless air over water Henry constant. \
> This module calculates the source and sink terms separately. The source is given as flux, the sink as deposition rate: \
>       **source = K<sub>g</sub> * H * C<sub>water</sub>     [kg m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>] **\
>       **sink   = K<sub>g</sub> / DEPHEIGHT      [s<sup>-1</sup>] **\
> The deposition rate is obtained by dividing the exchange velocity by the deposition height DEPHEIGHT, e.g. the height over which deposition occurs. \
> This can be either the first grid box only, or the entire planetary boundary layer. \
> The HEMCO option 'PBL_DRYDEP' determines which option is being used. \
> K<sub>g</sub> is calculated following Johnson, 2010, which is largely based on the work of Nightingale et al., 2000a/b. \
>  The salinity and seawater pH are currently set to constant global values  of 35 ppt and 8.0, respectively. 

go to **LINE690** of **hcox_seaflux_mod.F90**, the code here is:
```
    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ! Get species IDs and settings
    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    ! # of species for which air-sea exchange will be calculated
    Inst%nOcSpc = 7  ! updated to include MENO3, ETNO3, MOH

    ! Initialize vector w/ species information
    ALLOCATE ( Inst%OcSpecs(Inst%nOcSpc) )
    DO I = 1, Inst%nOcSpc
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%HcoID      = -1
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcSpcName  = ''
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcDataName = ''
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%LiqVol     = 0d0
       Inst%OcSpecs(I)%SCWPAR     = 1
    ENDDO

    ! Counter
    I = 0

    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    ! CH3I:
    ! ----------------------------------------------------------------------

    I = I + 1
    IF ( I > Inst%nOcSpc ) THEN
       CALL HCO_ERROR ( HcoState%Config%Err, ERR, RC )
       RETURN
    ENDIF

    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcSpcName  = 'CH3I'
    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%OcDataName = 'CH3I_SEAWATER'
    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%LiqVol     = 1d0*7d0 + 3d0*7d0 + 1d0*38.5d0 ! Johnson, 2010
    Inst%OcSpecs(I)%SCWPAR     = 1 ! Schmidt number following Johnson, 2010

```
Copy a loop and change the **OcSpcName** and **OcDataName** and conresponding **LiqVol** and **SCWPAR** and add **Inst%nOcSpc** by 1. \
Here, **OcSpcName** should exactly be the species name defined in GEOS-Chem, \
**OcDataName** is the array used to pass data, no restriction yet better to be self-explained, \
refer to the description in source code file about **LiqVol** and **SCWPAR**.
